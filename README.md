# 13ELE-BattleBot

### How to use:
This code is for an arduino nano with 4x small 3v motors, a TB6612FNG motor controller and a HC-05 bluetooth module. I'm using an app called DuinoJoy by LekPKD and converting the joystick values into tank steering values.

> **Note**\
> The power supply should be 7v - 12v, but you may want to get a converter to be safe on the higher voltages
